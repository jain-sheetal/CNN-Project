## 📌 Project Overview  

This project is a Deep Learning based Image Classification Web Application that predicts whether an uploaded image is a **Cat 🐱** or a **Dog 🐶**.

The model is developed using **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with **TensorFlow and Keras**, and deployed using **Streamlit Cloud**.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline:
- Model Training
- Model Saving (.h5)
- Web Integration
- Cloud Deployment

---

## 🎯 Objective of the Project  

The main objectives of this project are:

- To understand the working of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- To implement binary image classification
- To perform image preprocessing techniques
- To deploy a trained deep learning model as a web application
- To integrate AI with an interactive UI

## 🧠 About Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

CNN is a deep learning algorithm specially designed for image data.

It automatically extracts features such as:
- Edges
- Shapes
- Textures
- Patterns

### 🏗 Model Architecture Used:

1️⃣ Convolution Layer  
2️⃣ ReLU Activation Function  
3️⃣ MaxPooling Layer  
4️⃣ Flatten Layer  
5️⃣ Dense Layer  
6️⃣ Sigmoid Output Layer  

### 📊 Binary Classification Logic:

- Output > 0.5 → Dog 🐶  
- Output < 0.5 → Cat 🐱

## ⚙️ How the Application Works  

### Step 1: Load the Model
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model("CAT_DOG_MODEL.h5")
```

---

### Step 2: Upload Image
User uploads an image using Streamlit file uploader.

---

### Step 3: Image Preprocessing

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open(uploaded_file).resize((150,150))
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = img_array / 255.0
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
```

Final input shape:
```
(1, 150, 150, 3)
```

---

### Step 4: Prediction

```python
prediction = model.predict(img_array)
```

---

### Step 5: Display Result

```python
if prediction[0][0] > 0.5:
    st.success("Dog 🐶")
else:
    st.success("Cat 🐱")
```

---

## 🌐 Deployment
