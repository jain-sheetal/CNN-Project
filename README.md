# 🐾 Cat vs Dog Image Classification using CNN

[![Streamlit App](https://cnn-project-imageclassification.streamlit.app/)]

This project is a **Deep Learning** web application that classifies images of cats and dogs using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. It is built with **TensorFlow** and deployed via **Streamlit Cloud** for real-time accessibility.
